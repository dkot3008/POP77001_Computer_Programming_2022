# 5 Debugging and Testing in R

Finding and eliminating errors in code is one of (if not the most) frustrating part of computer
programming. This week we will focus on how to debug and test an R program. We will start
with the usage of print() statement to analyse the state of function calls and loops. After-
wards, we will discuss more structured ways of error-catching and debugging using built-in
R debugger.
