## Introduction

Give a brief introduction of the research question, and how you will answer it.

## Data

Import here the data and describe it. Include in the chunk below a brief summary

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
# copy paste the code to import the data
data <- read.csv("Data/height.csv")
#knitr::kable() #try to copy and paste here a relevant line of code as 
# an argument to the kable() function.
```

## Analysis

Describe how we analysed the data. You might wish to add a snippet of code within your analysis, such as `r round(mean(data$height), 2)`. Include below a relevant visualisation.

```{r data visualisation, echo = FALSE}

```

## Conclusion

Add a few words in conclusion. What weaknesses might there be in your research? What further questions might you answer?
